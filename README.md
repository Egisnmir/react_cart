#### To run it locally simply do:
1) npm install
2) npm start


The UX implementation of this card is done in an unusual way.
The "+" and "-" buttons only add or remove the ammount that is in the input field.

So basically to add something to a cart you first need to add the number to the input field and then press the "+" button.


#### Some things to improve could be:
1. Adding TypeScript.
2. Using Memoization to avoid unnecessary rendering.
3. Replacing the "+" & "-" buttons with an "Add" button and making a remove button in the carts list.
